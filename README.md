 Core Principle
Gravity's strength (κ) depends on both:
1. Local matter density (ρ)
2. Nonlocal hypergraph connectivity (∑Nₑ):

   \kappa(\rho, H) = \frac{\rho_0}{\rho} + \lambda \sum_{\text{nonlocal edges}} N_e

Emergent Spacetime from Hypergraph Dynamics

## The Dimensional Illusion
**Dimensions aren't fundamental**—they're approximate descriptions that emerge at large scales, much like temperature arises from atomic motion. In this framework:
- **3+1D spacetime** is a coarse-grained approximation of hypergraph connectivity
- **Gravity (κ)** couples local matter density (ρ) to nonlocal topology (∑Nₑ)
- **"Distance"** derives from interaction density, not primordial geometry

## Key Departures from Tradition
| Conventional View       | Hypergraph Emergence           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Dimensions are absolute  | Dimensions are statistical     |
| Spacetime is the stage   | Spacetime is the *play*        | 
| Nonlocality is "spooky"  | Nonlocality is structural      |

## Mathematical Emergence
The spectral dimension *dₛ* of the hypergraph determines observed spacetime:

d_s = -2\frac{d\ln P(s)}{d\ln s} \xrightarrow{\text{macroscopic}} 3+1  ---

  
where P(s) is the return probability of a random walk on the hypergraph.

Implications
Dark matter: κ-anomalies reflect topological defects

Quantum gravity: Entanglement = hyperedges across "dimensions"

Falsifiability: Predicts scale-dependent dimensionality in:

High-energy particle collisions

Black hole mergers (LIGO)

Cosmic voids (JWST)
